Anusha Kalyankar

I am a new member of the Spring Batch 2019 working on my Masters of Applied Computer Science in North West Missouri State University(NWMSU). I have enrolled for four courses in this semester, two of them being prerequisites and other two are core courses of my major.

I am from Hyderabad,Telangana, India. I did my schooling from Neo Royal High School and graduated from Bhoj Reddy Engineering College for Women, Electrical and Electronics Engineering(EEE) as major in the year 2015.My hobbies are playing badminton,travelling to places I haven't been before.In India, I have travelled tourist and pilgrim places in Tamil Nadu,Kerala,Maharastra and Andhra Pradesh.

I am interested in working as a software engineer in the IT field and extend my knowledge applying it in the real world and understanding the implementation of the concepts that I have in my academics for creating applications. I am interested in the current technology that is new and in use like cloud computing,machine learning,artificial intelligence and automation.

 I am very persistent for things that I want to learn no matter how hard they are to understand.
